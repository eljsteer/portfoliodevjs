          I&apos;m a full stack web developer from Christchurch, New Zealand, now living in the Northern Beaches of Sydney. 
          <br/>
          With a background in finance and accounting, I transitioned into software development to pursue my passion for problem-solving and creative solutions.
          <br/>
          After completing a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Sydney with a 97% grade, I honed my skills in the MERN stack. Since then, I&apos;ve been building a variety of projects and have many more ideas in the pipeline.
          I&apos;m always eager to learn, take on new challenges, and collaborate on exciting projects.
